## 🎬 Video Tutorial

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gk-sTNvOsR8&list=PL_csAAO9PQ8Yj7ZU7n2IJjIsqcFaLcvJN&index=4">SwiftUI Navigation - How to Navigate in SwiftUI Apps on YouTube</a></p>

This tutorial was made for `v.0.1.0.` I have improved and made `NavigationKit` even easier to use since this video. Read on to see how to use the newest version.

## 👉 Import

Import `NavigationKit` into your `View`

```
import NavigationKit
```

## 🧳 Features

Here's the list of the awesome features `NavigationKit` has:
- [X] default / custom transitions
- [X] push
- [X] push to view with id
- [X] pop
- [X] pop to view with id
- [X] pop to root
- [X] present (as modal / full screen)
- [X] may disable swipe down to dismiss on modal
- [X] dismiss
- [X] dismiss to root
- [X] combine `push` with `present` (good for showing Login / Onboarding / Tutorial)
- [X] built in Navigation Bars as view-modifiers (or build and use your own dream nav bar)
- [X] works perfectly with `TabView`

In SwiftUI navigtion is handeled by the `NavigationView` and `NavigationLink`. At the moment these views have some limitations:

- transition animations cannot be turned off or customised;
- we can't navigate back either to root (i.e. the first app view), or to a specific view;
- we can't push programmatically without using a `View`;
- customizing the `NavigationBar` is limited or it has to be done via `UINavigationBar.appearance()` (using `UIKit` 😒);
- `presenting` a view modally is done with the `.sheet` and `.fullScreenCover` view-modifiers adding confusion to the `NavigationLink`'s `push` like pattern; 

`NavigationKitView` is a view that mimics all the behaviours belonging to the standard `NavigationView`, but it adds the features listed here above. You have to wrap your view hierarchy inside a `NavigationKitView`:

```
import NavigationKit

struct RootView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationKitView {
            Tab_0_0_View()
        }
    }
}
```

You can even customise transitions and animations in some different ways. The `NavigationKitView` will apply them to the hierarchy: 

- you could decide to go for no transition at all by creating the navigation stack this way `NavigationStackView(transitionType: .none)`;
- you could create the navigation stack with a custom transition:

```
import NavigationKit

struct RootView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationKitView(transitionType: .custom(.scale)) {
            Tab_0_0_View()
        }
    }
}
```
`NavigationKitView` has a default easing for transitions. The easing can be customised during the initialisation
```
struct RootView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationKitView(transitionType: .custom(.scale), easing: .spring(response: 0.5, dampingFraction: 0.25, blendDuration: 0.5)) {
            Tab_0_0_View()
        }
    }
}
```
**Important:** The above is the recommended way to customise the easing function for your transitions. Please, note that you could even specify the easing this other way:

```
NavigationKitView(transitionType: .custom(AnyTransition.scale.animation(.spring(response: 0.5, dampingFraction: 0.25, blendDuration: 0.5))))
```

Attaching the easing directly to the transition? **Don't do this**. SwiftUI has still some problems with implicit animations attached to transitions, so it may not work. For example, implicit animations attached to a .slide transition won't work.

## ⬅️ Push

In order to navigate forward you have to `push` with an optional `delay`:

```
import NavigationKit

struct Tab_0_0_View: View {
    
    @EnvironmentObject private var navigation: Navigation
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                navigation.push(Tab_0_1_View(), delay: 1.5)
            } label: {
                Text("Next")
            }
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure you are using a view model in order for values to persist between push/pop operations. SwiftUI resets all the properties of a view marked with `@State` every time the view is removed from a view hierarchy. For the `NavigationKitView` this is a problem because when I come back to a previous view (with a pop operation) I want all my view controls to be as I left them before (for example I want my `TextField`s to contain the text I previously typed in). It seems that the solution to this problem is using the `.id` modifier specifying an id for the views I don't want SwiftUI to reset. According to the Apple documentation the `.id` modifier:

> Generates a uniquely identified view that can be inserted or removed.

but again, it seems that this API is currently not working as expected (take a look at this interesting post: https://swiftui-lab.com/swiftui-id/). In order to workaround this problem, then, you have to use `@ObservableObject` when you need to make some state persist between push/pop operations.

```
import NavigationKit

struct Tab_0_0_View: View {
    
    @EnvironmentObject private var navigation: Navigation
    @ObservedObject private var viewModel = Tab_0_0_ViewModel()
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            
            TextField("Type something...", text: $viewModel.text)
                .textFieldStyle(RoundedBorderTextFieldStyle())
            
            Button {
                self.viewModel.fetchData { (result) in
                    switch result {
                    case .success(let finished):
                        if finished {
                            navigation.push(Tab_0_2_View())
                        } else {
                            print("Something went wrong")
                        }
                    case .failure(let err):
                        print(err.localizedDescription)
                    }
                }
            } label: {
                Text("Push after model operation")
            }
            Spacer()
        }
    }
}
```

## 🆔 Specifying an ID 

It's not mandatory, but if you want to come back to a specific view at some point later you need to specify an ID for that view:

```
Button {
    navigation.push(Tab_0_1_View(), withId: "Tab_0_1_View")
} label: {
    Text("Next")
}
```
You will be able to `pop` to this view using the `id`. Read on. 🤓

## ➡️ Pop

Pop operation works as the push operation, with an optional `delay`:

```
Button {
    navigation.pop(delay: 1.5)
} label: {
    Label("Back", systemImage: "chevron.backward")
}
```
which pops to the previous view. You can even specify a destination for your pop operation:
```
Button {
    navigation.pop(to: .view(withId: "Tab_0_1_View"))
} label: {
    Text("Pop to Tab_0_1_View")
}
```
We can also pop to root like so:
```
Button {
    navigation.pop(to: .root)
} label: {
    Text("Pop to Root")
}
```

## 🚧 NavigationBar

`NavigationKit` replaces `NavigationView` altogether. In order to see a navigation bar you can create your own or use the built in view modifiers. You must add them as a modifier of a `VStack` which contains a `Spacer` to push its content up.

### Inline navigation bar

```
VStack {
    ...
    Spacer()
}
.inlineNavigationBar(titleView:
            Text("Tab_0_1_View").bold(),
        leadingView:
            Button {
                navigation.pop()
            } label: {
                Label("Back", systemImage: "chevron.backward")
            },
        trailingView:
            Button {
                navigation.push(Tab_0_2_View())
            } label: {
                Text("Next")
            },
        backgroundView:
            Color(.secondarySystemBackground).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)
)
```

### Large navigation bar

```
VStack {
    ...
    Spacer()
}
.largeNavigationBar(titleView:
            Text("Tab_0_0_View").bold().lineLimit(1),
        leadingView:
            EmptyView(),
        trailingView:
            Button {
                navigation.push(Tab_0_1_View(), withId: "Tab_0_1_View")
            } label: {
                Text("Next")
            },
        backgroundView:
            Color(.secondarySystemBackground).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)
)
```

### Custom navigation bar

```
var body: some View {
    VStack {
        ...
        Spacer()
    }.customNavigationBar(titleView:
                            HStack {
                                Text("TODAY").font(.title).fontWeight(.light)
                                Spacer()
                                Text(todayString().uppercased()).font(.title).fontWeight(.light)
                            },
                          backgroundView:
                            Color(.secondarySystemBackground).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)
    )
}

func todayString() -> String {
    let formatter = DateFormatter()
    formatter.dateFormat = "EEE MM/dd"
    return formatter.string(from: Date())
}
```

## ⬆️ Present

Presenting a modal is a bit diferent than pushing:

1. create a `@State` variable for your view;
2. add a `Sheet` or `FullScreenSheet` view with an optional `onDismiss` callback. You must add it to the view hierarchy. Don't worry they are `EmptyView`s;
3. activate the modal with `present()`

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: you can present a `NavigationKitView` inside a `Sheet` / `FullScreenSheet` 😎

```
import NavigationKit

struct Tab_1_0_View: View {
    
    // 1.
    @State private var navigationForTab_0_0_View = false
    @State private var navigationForTab_1_1_View = false
    
    @State private var navigationForTab_0_0_View_onDismiss = false
    @State private var navigationForTab_1_1_View_onDismiss = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Button {
                // 3.
                navigationForTab_0_0_View_onDismiss.present()
            } label: {
                Text("Present with onDismiss callback")
            }
            
            Button {
                // 3.
                navigationForTab_1_1_View_onDismiss.present()
            } label: {
                Text("Present with onDismiss callback")
            }
            
            Spacer()
            
            // 2.
            Sheet(isPresented: $navigationForTab_0_0_View) {
                NavigationKitView {
                    Tab_0_0_View() // <- contains push navigation
                }
            }
            
            // 2.
            FullScreenSheet(isPresented: $navigationForTab_1_1_View) {
                NavigationKitView {
                    Tab_1_1_View()
                }
            }
            
            // 2.
            Sheet(isPresented: $navigationForTab_0_0_View_onDismiss) {
                print("Dismissed Sheet. Do something here.")
            } content: {
                NavigationKitView {
                    Tab_0_0_View()
                }
            }
            
            // 2.
            FullScreenSheet(isPresented: $navigationForTab_1_1_View_onDismiss) {
                print("Dismissed FullScreenSheet. Do something here.")
            } content: {
                NavigationKitView {
                    Tab_1_1_View()
                }
            }
        }
        .padding()
        .largeNavigationBar(titleView:
                    Text("Tab_1_0_View").bold().lineLimit(1),
                leadingView:
                    Button {
                        // 3.
                        navigationForTab_0_0_View.present()
                    } label: {
                        Text("Present Navigation")
                    },
                trailingView:
                    Button {
                        // 3.
                        navigationForTab_1_1_View.present()
                    } label: {
                        Text("Present")
                    },
                backgroundView:
                    Color(.tertiarySystemBackground).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)
        )
    }
}
```

## ⬇️ Dismiss

Here's how you can dismiss the modal:

1. grab the `presentationMode` environment
2. dimiss with it's `wrappedValue`

```
struct Tab_1_1_View: View {
    
    // 1.
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Color(.systemRed).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
        }
        .largeNavigationBar(titleView:
                    Text("Tab_1_1_View").bold().lineLimit(1),
                leadingView:
                    Button {
                        // 2.
                        presentationMode.wrappedValue.dismiss()
                    } label: {
                        Text("Dismiss")
                    },
                trailingView:
                    EmptyView(),
                backgroundView:
                    Color(.tertiarySystemBackground).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)
        )
    }
}

```

You may also disable swipe down on the `Sheet`:

```
Sheet(isPresented: $navigationForTab_1_3_View) {
    NavigationKitView {
        Tab_1_3_View().disableSwipeToDismiss()
    }
}
```

If you want to dismiss to root you want to use `@Binding`s and dismiss in order. `0.25` is the optimal delay:

```
struct Tab_1_3_View: View {
    @Environment(\.presentationMode) var presentationMode
    
    @Binding var rootView: Bool
    @Binding var secondRootView: Bool
    @Binding var thirdRootView: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Color(.systemRed).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.all)
        }
        .largeNavigationBar(titleView:
                    Text("Tab_1_3_View").bold().lineLimit(1),
                leadingView:
                    EmptyView(),
                trailingView:
                    Button {
                        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now()) {
                            thirdRootView.dismiss()
                        }
                        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.25) {
                            secondRootView.dismiss()
                        }
                        DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) {
                            rootView.dismiss()
                        }
                    } label: {
                        Text("Dismiss to Root")
                    },
                backgroundView:
                    Color(.tertiarySystemBackground).edgesIgnoringSafeArea(.top)
        )
    }
}
```
